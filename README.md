# traveling salesman problem

Program solves traveling salesman problem, which is finding optimal cycle in given full graph, represented by cost matrix.

Code was created during course - Zaawansowane progrmowanie obiektowe - Automatyka i Robotyka (EAIIB)  

In order to solve particular problem, cost matrix needs to be made (forbidden transition are represented by INF alias). Next, solve_tsp function can be used, return value is a vector containing optimal solutions (example is presented in tests.c -  Rozwiazania.rozwiazanie_1).
